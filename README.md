# Modeling Ebola epidemics with Python
This python program uses matplotlib and numpy to simulate the projected outcome of an Ebola outbrak on a city.
It runs the SIR Model (Susceptible Infected Removed) to calculate these numbers. 
## How to use
Using the program is easy, simply clone the respository, and then edit the 'configuration.json' file. Just enter the paramters,
save it, and then run the 'ebola_sir_model.py' script. It will then output final numbers in the terminal and show you the plot it created.
## Dependencies
The only two dependencies are numpy and matplotlib, both of these can be installed with pip by entering the following commands into the terminal  
To install numpy: ```pip install numpy```  
To install matplotlib: ```pip install matplotlib```
